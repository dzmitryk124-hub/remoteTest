TASK

Ensuring the Acceptance Criteria are met, build a C# Web API that connects to an instance of a database and persists the contents of the Meter Reading CSV file.

We have provided you with a list of test customers along with their respective Account IDs (please refer to Test_Accounts.csv). Please seed the Test_Accounts.csv data into your chosen data storage technology and validate the Meter Read data against the accounts.

From the day you receive this test, you have 48 hours to submit your work for assessment.

Please send it to careers@ensek.co.uk. It is advised to use a publicly accessible Git repository to commit and share your work with us. Any work committed after the deadline won't be considered towards the technical assessment.

I want to be able to load a CSV file of Customer Meter Readings
 so that we can monitor their energy consumption and charge them accordingly
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

The endpoint should be able to process a CSV of meter readings. An example CSV file has been provided (Meter_reading.csv)

Each entry in the CSV should be validated and if valid, stored in a DB.

After processing, the number of successful/failed readings should be returned.



Validation:

You should not be able to load the same entry twice

A meter reading must be associated with an Account ID to be deemed valid

Reading values should be in the format NNNNN

NICE TO HAVE

Create a client in the technology of your choosing to consume the API. You can use angular/react/whatever you like

When an account has an existing read, ensure the new read isn't older than the existing read
